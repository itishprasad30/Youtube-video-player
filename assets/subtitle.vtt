00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:33.158
I saw the fire
in your eyes

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.203
I saw the fire when I
look into your eyes

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.749
You tell me things you want
to try

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.170
I know temptation is the
devil in disguise

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.340
You risk it all
to feel alive

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.927
You’re offering yourself
to me like sacrifice

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.890
You said you do this
all the time

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.935
Tell me you love me if I bring
you to the light

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:06.649
It’s like a dream what
she feels with me

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.487
She loves to be
on the edge

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.657
Her fantasy is okay
with me

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.453
Then suddenly baby says

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:22.165
Take my breath away

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.292
And make it last
forever babe

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.419
Do it now or never babe

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.006
Take my breath away

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:32.133
Nobody does it
better babe

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.343
Bring me close to

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.513
Want me to hold
on to you tight

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.226
You pull me closer feel the
heat between your thighs

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.604
You’re way too young
to end your life

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.817
Girl I don’t want to be the
one who pays the price

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:54.239
It’s like a dream what
she feels with me

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:58.076
She loves to be
on the edge

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.247
Her fantasy is okay
with me

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.502
Then suddenly baby says

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.798
Take my breath away

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:13.925
And make it last
forever babe

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.052
Do it now or never babe

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.639
Take my breath away

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.766
Nobody does it
better babe

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.018
Close to heaven babe

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.562
Take my breath

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.399
Ooh

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:38.241
Oh, oh-oh-ooh,
they'll see me

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.746
Oh-ooh, ooh-oh no

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:50.253
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:56.634
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:59.762
Oh, ooh-oh

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.224
Take my breath away

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.560
And make it last
forever, babe

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.645
Do it now or never, babe

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.149
Take my breath away

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.526
We’ll make love together,
babe

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.486
Bring me close
to heaven, babe

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.158
Take my breath

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.409
Oh darlin'

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.954
Take me breath

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.459
Nobody does it better babe

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.336
Bring me close
to heaven babe

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.254
Take my breath
